# Queues Simulator App

## Objective
The objective of the project is to design and implement a queue management application that assigns customers to queues in such a way that the waiting time is minimized.

## Use cases: 
The following data should be considered as input for the application and must be entered by the user in the application interface:

• Number of customers (N);
• Number of queues (Q);
• Simulation interval (maximum simulation time);
• Minimum and maximum arrival time (minimum arrival time ≤ arrival time ≤ maximum arrival time);
• Minimum and maximum service time (minimum service time ≤ service time ≤ maximum service time).
